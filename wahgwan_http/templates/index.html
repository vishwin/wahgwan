<h2>A different take on technology consulting, architecting and development</h2>
<p>Wahgwan Industry Limited is an <strong>independent</strong> technology company.</p>
<p>We design, build and maintain solutions for business problems, primarily serving small to medium-sized businesses and organisations. We take a fundamentalist, systems/toolkit and design thinking-based approach to not only help you achieve your goals but to ensure continued success.</p>
<p>To that end, our primary areas of expertise lie in backend systems architecting (including those for web applications) and embedded software development. We in particular service Unix-based and open source systems.</p>
<p>Wahgwan is located in the Main Line suburbs of Philadelphia, but we can remotely discuss, organise and deliver projects and services for clients located anywhere.</p>
<p>Please <a class="imail">email us</a> if we can be of any help to you or your group or to discuss your technology stuggles and needs. A consultant will respond back to you via email with further contact information or an appointment.</p>
