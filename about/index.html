	<h1>About us</h1>
	<p>A different take on technology consulting</p>
</div>
<div class="grid-container fluid">
<p>Wahgwan Industry Limited is an <strong>independent</strong> technology company dedicated to helping businesses, organisations and individuals use technology effectively and gainfully. Originally founded in 2016&ndash;17 as an offshoot of having hacked in over twenty hackathons on a variety of projects spanning disparate industries since 2013, the joy of leveraging technology to solve problems and enable higher quality of life was unparalleled. Combined with the personalised, relatable approach between technology and other subjects, it made sense to offer these kinds of services commercially.</p>
<p>Wahgwan is located in the Main Line suburbs of Philadelphia, but we can remotely discuss, organise and deliver projects and services for clients located anywhere.</p>

	<h1>The meaning of "wahgwan"</h1>
	<p>Originating from Jamaican English and Patois, a contraction of "what's going on". Also spelt "wagwan". Used as a greeting equivalent to "wassup".</p>

<h2>Our process</h2>
<h3>No salespeople, no bureaucracy, no BS</h3>
<p>You will always directly communicate with one doing your actual work. We don't answer to anything but your expectations and goals, allowing for better processes that lead to better solutions. We also do not arbitrarily pick components for any solution just because "everyone else" uses them.</p>
<p>For those solutions involving software, websites, etc, we are set up where you can see exactly what we do as we are working on your solution!</p>

<h3>User experience</h3>
<p>User experience is not just about how a user gets presented something. It drives even the behind-the-scenes internals of what one uses. Through story mapping, research and discovery of users' tendencies and behaviours, we tailor all parts of the solution to perform optimally at that, and we will measure whether it works or not!</p>

<h3>Leveraging open technologies</h3>
<p>Many components that come into use for solutions we develop already exist in the open. Most will have already been battle-tested in real-world situations for quite some time, and even more of those are fully supported and documented by their respective communities. As open technology development puts far more emphasis on quality and polish than purely commercial development, the resulting solutions will stand the test of time with minimal changes whilst providing better development paths in the future.</p>

<h3>Giving back</h3>
<p>Whenever we develop something as part of a solution for you that may be useful for others, we release it back to the community. Whenever we fix a problem in an existing component, we contribute the fix back to the original project. We believe a better world of technology would exist if more knowledge were available so the same things don't need to be done over and over again. Furthermore, we enjoy teaching, mentoring and living vicariously through the success of new folks in the technology field.</p>
